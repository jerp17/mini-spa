# mini-spa
Created a basic HTML file with a navigation menu and a main content container where page content will be dynamically injected.
Designed multiple "views" (Home, About, Contact) as JavaScript functions or template strings instead of separate HTML files.
Added click event listeners to navigation links to prevent default page reload behavior.
Used JavaScript to update the content container dynamically based on user navigation.
Implemented browser history handling using the History API (pushState, popstate) to maintain URL changes.
Added basic loading indicators during view switching to simulate real application behavior.
